summary of the day-
we created 2 functions :
find_array_dimensions
load_text

to do-
add to code checking that k and iter are valid
continue coding by pyton
fixing the pyton code - we need set arguments instead of field so ut will work($python3 kmeans.py 3 100 input_data.txt)

06/12

to do-
cry
fix python code
talk to Ben
get things to run 

09/12
made euclidian distance
finished most of the while loop
made two data structures- dict and vector

to do-

-free allocated memory 

ask ben:
-how update code to use stdin // return to this later
-that we properly freed the memory

-test invalid inputs for python and c
-add documentarion to all the funcs (not chofer)


-read whole forum to make sure we didnt miss anything
